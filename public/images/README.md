# OpenGraph Image Creation Guide

## Required OpenGraph Image

You need to create an image file called `rps-game-preview.jpg` with the following specifications:

- Dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (optimal size for social media sharing)
- File format: JPG or PNG
- File location: `/public/images/rps-game-preview.jpg`

## Design Suggestions

Create an image that:

1. Prominently displays the title "WasteTime Games - Rock Paper Scissors"
2. Shows the game icons (✊ ✋ ✌️) in an attractive layout
3. Uses a similar color scheme to your website (purple and blue gradients)
4. Includes a clear call-to-action like "Play Now!"
5. Keeps text large and readable when the image is displayed as a thumbnail

## Alternative Approach

If creating a custom image is challenging, you can simply create a screenshot of your game in action and crop it to the 1200x630 dimensions.

## Image Usage

This image will be used for:
- Facebook and other social media shares
- Twitter cards
- WhatsApp link previews
- Discord embeds
- Other platforms that support OpenGraph metadata
